    *  It waits for a second response from the server
    *  When the client receives a second response from the server, it knows tha the second client has connected.
        * the user of the first client is then prompted to type a message which is sent to the second client 
        * The first client waits for a response message from the second client 
        * When the first client receives the response message, it displays it to the user and prompts the user to type another message.
